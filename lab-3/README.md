# The Game

## Project Description
The game is a simple game where the player navigates a board from the START point to the STOP point while avoiding randomly placed obstacles. The game supports movement using keyboard arrow keys. Unit tests are implemented, and GitHub Actions is configured to automatically run these tests on each push or pull request.
